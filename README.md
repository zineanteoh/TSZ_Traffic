**Abstract:**

Traffic congestions are becoming more prevalent and costly with increasing rates of urbanization. One type of traffic congestion stems from cars traveling in one direction completely blocking the orthogonal direction when the light changes at the crossroad. We plan to intervene in the preset traffic light schedule using predicted car influx and outflux data to optimize passage of the aforementioned blocked direction. We set out to model our solution at the Sanlitun crossroad in Beijing, comparing the rate of total passage against the control group data. 

We attempt to solve preventable traffic congestion caused by cars in one direction blocking cars in the other direction at the crossroad. We do this by attempting to establish a connection between the traffic lights and the roads.
